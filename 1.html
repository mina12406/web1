  <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/introduction.html#a-quick-introduction-to-html=" target="_blank" title="optimization explained">A/B <u>optimization</u> testing</strong></a> is used to try out how changes to a minor element of an existing process affect customer engagement. The goal is to optimize the impact of that process,  getting the best results with the lowest cost to your company.
  <p>Typically, optimization tests compare the results—measured in click-throughs, email opens, social engagement, conversions, or by some other metric—of minute changes to design, wording, or visual elements.<br><br>Does a long email subject or a shorter one result in more opens? Does a green button or a red button get more clicks? Does a Facebook post with an image get more likes than one without?</p>

  <p>Because the tests measure audience engagement or other results based on very small changes, with little or no cost for each test, companies may perform many thousands of A/B tests per year. The data from testing then informs the next campaign.</p>
